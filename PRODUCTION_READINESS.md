## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS

### üîë Pre-Deployment Actions (REQUIRED)
- [x] **Rotate API Keys**: Replace all placeholder API keys with production keys
- [x] **Generate Secrets**: Create strong random strings for JWT_SECRET, SESSION_SECRET
- [x] **Domain Configuration**: Update all domain references from "yourdomain.com" to "temitayocharles.online"
- [ ] **SSL Certificates**: Ensure cert-manager is installed in cluster
- [ ] **DNS Setup**: Configure DNS records for temitayocharles.online (see DNS_CONFIGURATION.md)

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Setup (REQUIRED)
- [ ] **Kubernetes Cluster**: Ensure cluster meets resource requirements
- [ ] **Storage Classes**: Verify storage classes exist in cluster
- [ ] **Ingress Controller**: Install and configure NGINX ingress controller
- [ ] **Cert Manager**: Install cert-manager for SSL certificates
- [ ] **Monitoring Stack**: Deploy Prometheus and Grafana operators

### üîí Security Validation (REQUIRED)
- [ ] **Security Audit**: Run security scanning tools
- [ ] **Vulnerability Assessment**: Check for CVEs in dependencies
- [ ] **Access Control**: Implement RBAC for production access
- [ ] **Network Security**: Validate network policies
- [ ] **Secret Management**: Implement proper secret rotation

### üìä Monitoring Setup (REQUIRED)
- [ ] **Alert Channels**: Configure alert notifications (Slack webhook needs to be updated)
  - **Issue**: Previous Slack webhook was invalidated for security
  - **Solution**: Generate new webhook URL from Slack and update `monitoring/alertmanager.yml`
  - **Steps**: See instructions in `monitoring/alertmanager.yml` comments
- [ ] **Log Aggregation**: Set up centralized logging (ELK stack)
- [ ] **Metrics Storage**: Configure long-term metrics retention
- [ ] **Dashboard Access**: Set up team access to Grafana dashboards
